# Proxy Scrapper

## Description

This is a simple proxy scrapper that scrapes proxies from specified websites. It test the proxies and prints the working ones in stdout, meaning you can save proxies that work for that specific website to a file using the `>` operator. This is not a CLI tool it is meant to be used as a library.
